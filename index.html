  <h2>My pet Bacon</h2>
  <p>My pet is a pig named Bacon. (I know, I know) I'll get to why I named him Bacon. I found Bacon along the side of the road, abandoned, in the summer of 2020 and I thought, "My God, how very cute". Needless to say, he immediately stole my heart. In hindsight I might have stolen someone's pig, but I digress.</p>
  <p>Bacon is not shy at all, always grunting running at strangers as if to chase them away, always cracks me up.(He thinks he's a dog).</p>
  <p>Bacon's favorite activities include:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Grunting when hungry</li>
    <li>Tag</li>
    <li>Taking walks</li>
    <li>Swimming</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Bacon's favorite meal is:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Everything, honestly, I've seen him chewing on a piece of brick once. Saves up on feed at least ;) (Wait till he finds out what my favorite meal is *wink *wink)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Bacon doesn't have a favorite toy. I tried buying him a chew toy. He ate it. I tried buying a mini piglet to play with. He ate it. Goddamit he ate Stevie :(</p>
